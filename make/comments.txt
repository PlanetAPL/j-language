***
Optimization:
Previous gcc based release versions of J were built with -O3.
Sometimes this caused the tests to fail and a lot of work was
done to track down the problem and reduce the optimization
either in a particular file or by removing the flag that caused the
problem. This was painful work.

OSX tests had nan problems with O2 and 03 but ran clean with 01.

Timing the running of the entire test suite in linux and osx showed
negligible difference between 01 and 03. And the O3 binary was 25%
larger.

O1 is now the official level for J unix releases.
