jdll.tlb is a binary file encoding the com interface type library

jdll.rc includes jdll.tlb

midl.exe (originally mktyplib.exe) builds jdll.tlb from:
 jdllodl.h  jdll.odl (which includes methods.odl)

build.bat builds jdll.tlb binary from the 3 source files

build.bat must be run under vs developer command prompt with midl as current folder
(start>all programs>vs 2013>visual studio tools>developer command prompt)

new jdll.tlb should be manually copied to dllsrc for inclusion in new build
