how to build windows binaries using command line
**************************************************************************
general:

1. Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop
you are urged to use vs2013 (doesn't have to be express) if possible
vs2012 is ok, but vs2015 has problems and is best avoided for now

in theory the _xp platform toolset binaries run on xp (but not tested)
xp support will be dropped in the next year or so

2. examples use powershell, but works command prompt as well

3. examples assume gitdev\jsource is the jsource folder

4. jbld hardwired as build folder

5. create jbld folder
...> gitdev\jsource\makemsvc\install.bat gitdev

6. edit jsrc\jversion.h as appropriate for 9!:14 result
jsrc\jversion-x.h is template for this file

7. copy binaries to release folder
...>release.bat

**************************************************************************
j64 

0. start powershell and cd to this folder
run the batch file vcvarsx86_amd64.bat in vs2013 vc\bin\x86_amd64 folder

1. build jconsole.exe
nmake -f makefile.win x64=1 clean
nmake -f makefile.win x64=1
cd ..

2. build j.dll
same as for jconsole but cd into jdll
 
3. build tsdll.dll -  used in test suite to validate cd 
same as for jconsole but cd into tsdll

4. run test suite
copy jconsole.exe to jbld\j64\bin\jconsole.exe
similarly for j.dll and tsdll.dll

start powershell
...>jbld\j64\bin\jconsole.exe
   i.5
   9!:14''
...
   testpath=:'gitdev/jsource/test/'
   load testpath,'tsu.ijs'
   RUN ddall NB. takes a few minutes to validate system and report problems

j32

0. start powershell and cd to this folder
run the batch file vcvars32.bat in vs2013 vc\bin folder

1. build jconsole.exe
cd jconsole
nmake -f makefile.win clean
nmake -f makefile.win
cd ..

2. build j.dll
same as for jconsole but cd into jdll
 
3. build tsdll.dll -  used in test suite to validate cd 
same as for jconsole but cd into tsdll

4. run test suite
copy jconsole32.exe to jbld\j32\bin\jconsole.exe
similarly for j32.dll and tsdll32.dll

start powershell
...>jbld\j32\bin\jconsole.exe
   i.5
   9!:14''
...
   testpath=:'gitdev/jsource/test/'
   load testpath,'tsu.ijs'
   RUN ddall NB. takes a few minutes to validate system and report problems
